![Design preview for the Newsletter sign-up form with success message coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge.

The users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Technologies used

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Responsive

The app is responsive. It works perfectly on mobile screens.
